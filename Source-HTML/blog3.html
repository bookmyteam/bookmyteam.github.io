          <span>Eliminate distractions: </span> Turn off the computer, TV and music. It will be difficult for you to concentrate on reading, especially when reading something that is difficult to understand if distracted. Focusing on reading means you'll find a place that's comfortable, pleasant, and won't distract you. Make reading more fun by preparing extra snacks or drinks and creating a sense of comfort. Light a scented candle or read a book in the bath to feel refreshed and make reading more enjoyable, especially if you're not too interested in what you're reading.

        <span>Skip before reading carefully.</span> If you read something that is difficult to understand, don't worry too much about losing interest because you already know the ending. If you're reading a passage and have to start over again, try skimming the entire story or flipping through the next few pages to understand the setting, main characters, and tone of what you're reading. ; that way, you'll know what to focus on when you read the content carefully.[1] Searching for summaries (such as on Cliff's Note) or the contents of the book online is a good way to get the gist to make it easier to understand the book, but be aware that some teachers won't be satisfied. with this and may give a low or no score if they know you've only read the summary. So don't forget to open the book and read it carefully.

        <span>Imagine what you are reading.</span> Imagine you are a movie director and visualize what happens as you read. Make a cast list for the movie if it works, and try to visualize the events as realistically as possible. This is a very interesting activity and helps you remember and understand the content better.

        <span>Read out loud: </span> Some people find it easier to focus and find content more enjoyable when they read it aloud. Find a quiet room, or hide in the basement and enjoy reading in the tone you want. This helps you slow down if you're often trying to skim quickly, and also makes the content seem more alive when you get bored. Try reading poems aloud. The experience of reading "Odyssey" becomes even better when you read out loud the melody of the poem.

After every 45 minutes of reading, you should relax for 15 minutes or do another exercise to clear your mind and allow yourself to focus on other things for a while.
